# Bott
Browser automation and machine learning using Python3

This project is in its very early stages I intent to enhance it in following steps:
  1. Giving Bott functionality to tweet pictures and text on certain topics, by scrapping information related to that topic from  
  the internet own its own.
  2. Giving Bott functionality to follow people on twitter by analysing its own tweets in history, (example: if Bott tweets about       term "space", it must follow some people posting similar things to "space".
  3. Giving Bott functionality to retweeting and commenting posts of the people its following by analysing how others reacted to that post.
  
  Also doing all above without getting caught by twitter alogorithms.
